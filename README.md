For the count and metadata matrices used in our analysis, go here:  https://github.com/farrellja/URD/tree/master/Analyses/QuickStart/data


Before running the analysis script, make sure to include a 'data' folder in the same directory where the analysis script is.
Place the count and metadata matrices in this folder. The Script assumes that the raw data files are placed there.
